# N8N-Automations
Production-ready n8n workflows integrating SQL, CRM, OpenAI API, and analytics dashboards for automated data pipelines and AI-powered reporting.
This repository contains a collection of production-ready n8n workflows designed to automate data ingestion, transformation, AI-driven processing, and business reporting.

These workflows demonstrate how n8n can function as a lightweight orchestration engine connecting CRM systems, SQL databases, marketing platforms, and OpenAI-powered AI services to build scalable, real-time automation pipelines.

The goal of this project is to reduce manual reporting, improve data accuracy, and enable intelligent, automated decision support systems.

Business Context

Modern data teams often face:

Manual CRM and marketing data extraction

Repetitive SQL reporting tasks

Delayed KPI visibility

Fragmented data sources

Lack of AI-driven automation

This repository provides reusable workflow templates solving those problems using n8n as the orchestration layer.
